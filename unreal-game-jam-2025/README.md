# Unreal Engine Game Jam (48-Hour Challenge)

Personal C++ contribution to a father-son Unreal Engine game jam project.

## My Role (C++)
- Implemented core vector math utilities (dot product, cross product, normalization)
- Built randomization systems for procedural generation
- Designed game logic components in modern C++

## Tech
- Unreal Engine 5 (C++ backend)
- Visual Studio 2022

## Note
This repo contains only my C++ source code (no full UE project, assets, or Blueprints) to keep it lightweight and focused on code quality.

The complete game (including Blueprints by my son) was built in 48 hours for [Global Game Jam (GGJ) 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/).

## Game Summary
The game takes place in a fish tank. A bubble with a fish inside it is floating around. A cat paw moves back and forth, and periodically pounces toward the bubble to try and pop it to catch the fish. The player controls the bubble's movement to avoid the cat paw. Paw movements and intervals between pounces speed up the longer the game lasts. The game ends when the paw touches the bubble (it pops and the fish is caught).
